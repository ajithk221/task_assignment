//UserProfile

1. UseEffect dependency is empty, compontent won't re-fetch when userId changes.
         useEffect(()=>{...},[userId])

2.useState<any> can loose typescript benefits. we can define user type for Type Safety.
   -- we can use null to prevent runtime errors.
   type User ={
    id: number;
    name: string;
    bio: string;
   }

   const [user, setUser] = useState<User| null>(null);

3. null used for both loading and no data/ error. It may get chance to miss error.
   --  If loading or error is there means, we can get clear UI states and easy to test.


//TEST COVERAGE

1. we can also cover loading, sucess, network error.
